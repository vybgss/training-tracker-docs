    <h1>Training Tracker - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: December 18, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>
      We respect your privacy 
      and are committed to safeguarding any information you provide while using our 
      iOS application, <strong>Training Tracker</strong>. This Privacy Policy outlines how 
      we collect, use, and protect your information. By using <strong>Training Tracker</strong>, 
      you agree to the practices described herein.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Training Tracker</strong> does not require you to create an account or provide any 
      personal identifiable information. We do not collect, store, or transmit any data 
      related to your identity or personal contacts.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Usage Data</h2>
    <p>
      We may collect non-personally identifiable data related to the performance and usage 
      of the app (such as crash logs or error reports) through Apple’s built-in analytics 
      or other trusted frameworks. This data helps us improve app reliability and enhance 
      user experience. No personally identifiable information is included in this data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Training Tracker</strong> does not integrate with external services that collect 
      personal data. Any analytics or diagnostic information is handled securely through 
      Apple’s ecosystem (if you have opted in) and is anonymized.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not store personal data, you do not need to worry about private information 
      being compromised. Local settings, match data, and scores you track remain on your 
      device. We rely on Apple’s standard security and sandboxing measures to protect 
      app integrity.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Training Tracker</strong> is suitable for all ages and does not collect personal 
      information from children. Since we do not store personal data, there is no risk to 
      child privacy within our app.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our 
      practices or due to regulatory requirements. Any modifications will be posted 
      on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review this 
      Policy periodically.
    </p>
